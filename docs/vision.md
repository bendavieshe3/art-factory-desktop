# Art Factory Vision

## Project Purpose

Art Factory is a tool for managing the generation, remixing and refinement of exquisite images, videos, and multimedia products from the latest internet and local generative AI services.

## Core Vision

This project will at a high level:
- Command, automate and batch image generation from multiple AI art providers
- Enable the review, assessment, comparison, organization and management of generated AI images
- Be installed locally for a single user, enabling interactions through an interactive web application

## Factory Metaphor

Art Factory uses factory abstractions, where the application under the user's guidance produces *Products* (images, videos, other media) from *Factory Machines* using a *Production Line* to organize the workflow.

These abstractions organize the workflow into areas of **Specification** (defining what to create), **Production** (the creation process), and **Inventory** (managing the results).

## Value Proposition

### For Content Creators
- **Batch Processing**: Generate multiple variations efficiently
- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use the best models from different providers
- **Smart Parameters**: Intelligent token expansion and parameter interpolation
- **Organization**: Project-based organization with collections and favorites

### For AI Art Enthusiasts
- **Experimentation**: Easy parameter tweaking and comparison
- **Gallery Management**: Rich viewing and organization capabilities
- **Template System**: Save and reuse successful parameter combinations
- **Local Control**: Full ownership and privacy of generated content

## Target User

Single-user local deployment for:
- Digital artists exploring AI-generated content
- Content creators needing batch generation capabilities
- AI enthusiasts wanting organized experimentation
- Users requiring local control and privacy of their generated art

## Deployment Philosophy

Designed for local deployment on the developer's Mac operating system. Considerations such as cloud storage, CDNs and other scaling measures for multi-user commercial use are not applicable. This focused scope enables:
- Simple installation and setup
- No privacy or security concerns with cloud services
- Full control over generated content and parameters
- Offline capability for viewing and organizing existing work
