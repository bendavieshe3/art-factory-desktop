# Art Factory Implementation - Clarifying Questions

## 1. Technology Stack Decisions

### Backend Framework
**Question**: What backend technology should we use?
- **Option A**: Python with FastAPI (excellent async support, good for AI/ML integration)
- **Option B**: Node.js with Express/NestJS (unified JS/TS stack)
- **Option C**: Go (high performance, excellent concurrency)
**Recommendation**: Python with FastAPI - best ecosystem for AI provider integrations

### Frontend Framework
**Question**: What frontend framework should we use?
- **Option A**: React with TypeScript (mature, extensive ecosystem)
- **Option B**: Vue.js 3 (simpler learning curve, good performance)
- **Option C**: SvelteKit (modern, performant, simpler state management)
**Recommendation**: React with TypeScript for component reusability and ecosystem

### Database
**Question**: Should we use SQLite exclusively or consider PostgreSQL?
- **Option A**: SQLite only (simple, zero-config, sufficient for single-user)
- **Option B**: PostgreSQL (better concurrent writes, JSON support, full-text search)
**Recommendation**: Start with SQLite, design for easy migration to PostgreSQL

## 2. Architecture Decisions

### API Design
**Question**: REST vs GraphQL for the API?
- **Option A**: RESTful API (simpler, well-understood)
- **Option B**: GraphQL (flexible queries, better for complex UI needs)
**Recommendation**: REST with option to add GraphQL later

### Real-time Updates
**Question**: How should we handle real-time generation progress?
- **Option A**: WebSockets (bidirectional, real-time)
- **Option B**: Server-Sent Events (simpler, one-way)
- **Option C**: Polling (simplest, higher latency)
**Recommendation**: WebSockets for generation progress, SSE as fallback

### File Storage
**Question**: How should we organize generated media files?
- **Option A**: Date-based folders (YYYY/MM/DD/filename)
- **Option B**: Project-based folders (projects/project-id/products/)
- **Option C**: Content-hash based (ab/cd/ef/hash.ext)
**Recommendation**: Project-based with content-hash for deduplication

## 3. Provider Integration

### API Key Management
**Question**: How should users manage provider API keys?
- Store encrypted in database?
- Use environment variables?
- Support both options?
**Recommendation**: Encrypted database storage with UI management

### Rate Limiting
**Question**: How to handle provider rate limits?
- Per-provider queue system?
- Configurable delays?
- Automatic retry with backoff?
**Recommendation**: All of the above with configurable limits per provider

### Provider Failures
**Question**: How to handle provider API failures?
- Automatic retry strategy?
- Dead letter queue for failed generations?
- User notification approach?
**Recommendation**: Exponential backoff retry with user notifications

## 4. User Experience

### Batch Operations
**Question**: Maximum batch size for token expansion?
- Hard limit (e.g., 100 generations)?
- User-configurable limit?
- Warning thresholds?
**Recommendation**: Configurable with defaults and warnings

### Image Preview
**Question**: Thumbnail generation approach?
- Generate on upload/import?
- Lazy generation on first view?
- Multiple sizes?
**Recommendation**: Generate multiple sizes on creation, cache aggressively

### Product Organization
**Question**: Default product sorting and filtering?
- By creation date?
- By project/collection?
- By quality metrics?
**Recommendation**: Multiple sort options with user preference persistence

## 5. Development Process

### Testing Requirements
**Question**: What testing coverage should we target?
- Unit tests only for core logic?
- Integration tests for API endpoints?
- E2E tests for critical user flows?
**Recommendation**: 80% unit test coverage, integration tests for all endpoints, E2E for critical paths

### Development Environment
**Question**: Containerization approach?
- Docker for all services?
- Docker Compose for local dev?
- Native installation option?
**Recommendation**: Docker Compose for development, native install for production

### CI/CD Pipeline
**Question**: Automated deployment needs?
- GitHub Actions for CI?
- Automated testing on PR?
- Release automation?
**Recommendation**: GitHub Actions with test automation, manual release process

## 6. Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
**Question**: What should we cache and where?
- Redis for session/temporary data?
- In-memory caching for frequently accessed data?
- CDN for static assets?
**Recommendation**: In-memory cache for single-user, prepare for Redis if scaling

### Background Jobs
**Question**: How to handle long-running generation tasks?
- Celery (Python)?
- Bull/BullMQ (Node.js)?
- Custom queue implementation?
**Recommendation**: Celery with Redis backend for Python, or built-in asyncio

### Database Optimization
**Question**: Indexing and query optimization priorities?
- Index all foreign keys?
- Full-text search on prompts?
- Materialized views for statistics?
**Recommendation**: Strategic indexing with query analysis, consider FTS for prompts

## 7. Security & Privacy

### Authentication
**Question**: Single-user authentication approach?
- No auth (local only)?
- Simple password protection?
- OAuth integration?
**Recommendation**: Optional password protection with secure defaults

### Data Privacy
**Question**: Data retention and cleanup?
- Automatic cleanup of old generations?
- Export functionality for user data?
- Encryption at rest?
**Recommendation**: Manual cleanup tools, full export capability, optional encryption

## 8. Extensibility

### Plugin System
**Question**: Support for custom providers/factories?
- Plugin architecture from start?
- Hardcoded providers initially?
- Hot-reload capability?
**Recommendation**: Design for plugins but implement core providers first

### API Extensions
**Question**: Third-party integration support?
- Public API documentation?
- Webhook support?
- API versioning strategy?
**Recommendation**: Internal API first, prepare for public API later

## Next Steps
