# Task Prioritization

Help me prioritize and organize tasks for maximum productivity:

1. Review current state:
   - Read ./docs/TASKS.md for all tasks
   - Identify dependencies between tasks
   - Note any blocked tasks

2. Analyze task priorities:
   - List all P0 (Critical) tasks that must be done immediately
   - List all P1 (High) tasks that should be done soon
   - Review P2/P3 tasks for any that should be promoted

3. Suggest optimal task order:
   - Consider dependencies (what blocks other work?)
   - Group related tasks that can be done together
   - Balance different types of work (backend/frontend/docs)
   - Identify quick wins (tasks < 2 hours)

4. Recommend focus areas:
   - What should be worked on today?
   - What are the next 3-5 tasks to tackle?
   - Are there any tasks that can be deferred or removed?

5. Update TASKS.md with:
   - Adjusted priorities if needed
   - Reordered tasks within sections
   - Clear dependencies noted
   - Current date as "Last Updated"

6. Provide actionable next steps:
   - Specific task to start with
   - Estimated time to complete current focus
   - Any preparation needed before starting

Format as a clear prioritization plan with reasoning for the suggested order.
