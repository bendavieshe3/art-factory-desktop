2. For each "IN PROGRESS" task:
   - Review the checklist items
   - Calculate completion percentage
   - Identify any blockers or issues
   - Note if taking longer than estimated

3. Provide a summary that includes:
   - Total tasks and completion status (X of Y completed)
   - Tasks currently in progress
   - Recently completed tasks
   - High priority TODO items (P0/P1)
   - Any blocked tasks
   - Suggested next tasks to start

4. Update the TASKS.md file with:
   - Current task statuses
   - Completed checklist items
   - Updated task counts
   - Current date as "Last Updated"

5. If any tasks have been in progress for extended periods, flag them for review

Format the response as a clear, concise status update.
